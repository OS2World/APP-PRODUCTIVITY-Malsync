/* WARNING (miket):  The resources for this message box are all screwed up.
    I couldn't get multiple scripts to be included in a single project, so
    the resource.h defines are duplicated in several places, and the
    resources themselves are duplicated.  I recommend grepping for things
    like IDC_LINK to find everything. */
