Malsync is a command line utility to sync AvantGo.com. Here is what you 
need to do to compile. 

1. Get a copy of pilot-link version 0.9.3 
(http://www.tomw.org/malsync/pilot-link.0.9.3.tgz)
2. You need libpisock.a. 
   - cd to the directory you extracted pilot-link to.
   - run "configure"
   - "cd libsock"
   - "make libpisock.a"
2. uncompress and untar the malsync distribution. 
3. cd malsync/mal/client/unix
4. edit the Makefile in the mal/client/unix directory. Change 
"PILOT_LINK_DIR" to the appropriate directory where pilot-link is located.
5. Type "make" and it should all work. 

Checkout the stuff in malsync/Docs about syncing and running.
